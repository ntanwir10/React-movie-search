# MOVIE BROWSER
 
This is movie search WebApp build using Reactjs and Redux. I have used The Movie Database (TMDb) API movie API to fetch list of movies and display them. 

Link to TMDB's API https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

I build this app only as a Proof of Concept and also to showcase my knowledge and skills.

Follow these steps to run this app.

Firstly, create your own key from TMDB's site and use that API_KEY in movie-browser.service.js. Then,

1. Git clone.
2. npm install
3. npm start. This will open the application in your browser in Development.

To check Production Build: 

Do npm build in step 3. This is create a dist folder containing bundle.js and index.html only. Double-click on index.html to open it in your browser.
